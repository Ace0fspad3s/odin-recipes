I'm not exactly sure what i'm supposed to write here..
but this is what i'm being asked to do:
    write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

Course URL: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

Seems like this website will consist of a main page and links to a handful of recipes. Its not meant to be a fully fledged/functional/pretty website but should help me learn HTML.

I already have a basic understanding of HTML/CSS but this is my first time doing it via The Odin Project.

I am a big fan of The Odin Project so far as it has made me learn GIT, and also uses local tools versus doing everything online via a web interface. This makes it feel like i'm using tools closer to what i'd actually be working with even when i'm finished with this course.
